After spinning the wheel of fortune, you can pick some consonants, to win money from good letter choices, buy vowels, to make main task little easier, or guess the answer, if you are sure that you found right answer. Everything is controlled by timer, the faster you found answer, the better bonus you will get after the end of the round. Your final result depends on speed, accuracy and knowledge.

App design, wheel design and logo also made by myself in Figma and Canva. 

## What I learned?

That was my second attempt to reproduce TV show to React app. In first attempt I've made the copy of "Deal or No Deal" and now I wanted to do another step in my development path. This app was for me above all a big test in programmic thinking. "Wykręć sobie fortunę" is much more complicated, it required more preparations, more to planning "step by step", more components are closely connected. I also wanted to create "fuller" app, with better repeat value and I think that I have done it. It was also first time with React and Tailwind together, thanks to this project I have also experienced Framer Motion library.

## How to improve app?

- Adding more animations and transitions to breathe more "life" into this app.
- Adding english version of app.
